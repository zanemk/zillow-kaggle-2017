# Is there, perhaps, a spatial pattern to where zillow gets it wrong? (a priori, I doubt it)

# decomposing into sub-elements:
# 1) There are 'house' effects - the intangibles of a particular property (well not really intangible but obviously not captured here)
# 2) neighborhood effects - the zips aren't very well balanced but we can live with that
#     There are also census block and tracts for neighborhoods

# Speculating some base elements of the error level:
    # the baseline price (perhaps locally constrained) for a house
    # house-specific effects - most of the property records (hottubs, etc.)
        # further - area or neighborhood effects that aren't captured by this data and
        # we can't get at in phase 1 (perhaps census block or zip is an instrument for this, albeit a poor signal)
    # buyer specific effects - these we probably can't get at, not with this data
